   <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Tubman#Other_honors_and_commemorations"><p>The difference between us is very marked. Most that I have done and suffered in the service of our cause has been in public, and I have received much encouragement at every step of the way. You, on the other hand, have labored in a private way. I have wrought in the day – you in the night. ... The midnight sky and the silent stars have been the witnesses of your devotion to freedom and of your heroism. Excepting John Brown – of sacred memory – I know of no one who has willingly encountered more perils and hardships to serve our enslaved people than you have</p><cite>--Frederick Douglass</cite>
